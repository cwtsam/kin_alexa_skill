# Kin Voice Project - Custom Amazon Alexa Skill

This Amazon Alexa Skill (a third-party feature that can be installed and accessed via Amazon Echo device) enables users to set reminders, issues the reminders to users and plays the reminder audio in the voice of the userâ€™s kin.

It is meant to work with a Django API for the generation of the reminder audio (https://github.com/cwtsam/kinvoice_django).
